		<title>Objective</title>
		<description>
			Seeking a position in software development, acting as
			lead developer,
			systems architect, project manager, or other business critical IT role.

		<title>Overview</title>
		<description>
			From 1996 through 2000 my experience was in coding all
			aspects of the web with ASP, Perl, Cold Fusion, and MSSQL. Between
			2000 and 2008 I
			focused primarily on open source technologies, with an emphasis on java, and
			J2EE development. Since 2008, I've deepened my exposure to and
			utilization of open
			source software, delivering efficient, and secure solutions across a
			variety of business
			needs.
		</description>
		<description>
			As a member of a team, and part of an organization, I've
			always tried to be a fun dependable
			co-worker, believing that successful software is a combination of clear
			objectives, and team
			cohesion. My best work is on projects that I find innately scientific curious,
			either technically
			or from a fundamental business perspective.
		</description>
		<description>
			My development philosophy is Agile based, preferring
			short sprints with tangible improvements that
			are easily integrated. I enjoy mentoring others, but am equally happy
			learning something new. My strengths
			are best utilized in both the back-end and middle-tier conceptualizing
			business logic as sound, secure software.
